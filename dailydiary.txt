I have not kept a daily diary.

I allready had some programming knowledge in Java and Xcode(iOS).
But I wanted to know whats the different between iOS and Android programming, but there is not much difference.
Throughout my study in Finnland I gained much more knowledge and I was able to use this programming skill for this course.
So I tried my best and created a usefull app I would like to have for myself (we are just ignoring the fact that I am an Apple user).

Pushing the project to Github was easy with a video and it also worked very well.
